          Please read this section carefully since it limits the liability of ADSC and its parents, subsidiaries, affiliates, related companies, officers, directors, employees, agents, representatives, partners, and licensors (collectively, the "ADSC Entities"). Each of the subsections below only applies up to the maximum extent permitted under applicable law. Some jurisdictions do not allow the disclaimer of implied warranties or the limitation of liability in contracts, and as a result the contents of this section may not apply to you. Nothing in this section is intended to limit any rights you may have which may not be lawfully limited.

No advice or information, whether oral or written, obtained from the ADSC Entities or through the Service, will create any warranty not expressly made herein.
        </p>
